# Implementation Summary: Default Admin User Migration

## Issue Description
Create a migration to add a default admin user with the following credentials:
- Email: ernestgm2006@gmail.com
- Password: Admin.2025
- Name: Admin

## Implementation Details

### 1. Migration File Creation
Created a new migration file `20250724053300_add_default_admin_user.rb` in the `db/migrate` directory. This migration:

- Checks if a user with the email 'ernestgm2006@gmail.com' already exists
- If not, creates a new admin user with the specified credentials
- Uses SQL directly to avoid model dependencies
- Properly hashes the password using BCrypt
- Sets the created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Provides a way to revert the change if needed (down method)

### 2. Migration Implementation Approach
The migration uses direct SQL queries instead of the User model for several reasons:
- Avoids potential issues with model dependencies
- Ensures the migration will work even if the User model changes in the future
- Provides better compatibility across different environments
- Follows best practices for data migrations

### 3. Password Security
The password is properly encrypted using BCrypt, the same encryption method used by Rails' `has_secure_password`. This ensures that the password is stored securely in the database.

### 4. Documentation
Created a comprehensive instruction document `ADMIN_USER_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` that provides:
- Details about the migration
- Step-by-step instructions for running the migration in the Docker environment
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting tips
- Instructions for reverting the migration if needed

## How to Apply the Migration
The migration can be applied by running:
```bash
docker-compose exec rorbackend rails db:migrate
```

For detailed instructions, please refer to the `ADMIN_USER_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.

## Verification
After running the migration, you can verify that the admin user was created by checking the database:
```bash
docker-compose exec rorbackend rails console
User.find_by(email: 'ernestgm2006@gmail.com')
```

## Conclusion
This implementation satisfies the requirements by creating a migration that adds a default admin user with the specified credentials. The migration is robust, follows best practices, and includes proper documentation for the development team.
