# Media Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the media management features as requested in the issue description. The implementation allows users to upload and manage different types of media (images, videos, audio), associate them with slides, and configure how they are displayed.

## Requirements Implemented

1. **Media Types Support**:
   - Users can now upload media of type video, audio, and images
   - Media files are stored in the appropriate directories based on type

2. **Owner-Based Access Control**:
   - Administrators can manage all media
   - Owners can only create, edit, or delete their own media
   - Media is associated with both an owner (user) and a business

3. **Slide Media Management**:
   - Slides can have multiple media items
   - Media can be ordered within a slide
   - Each media has a configurable duration (default: 5 seconds)
   - Image media can have an associated audio
   - Media can have an associated QR code
   - Media can have a description with configurable position and text size

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

1. **Media Table**:
   - Added `owner_id` (references users)
   - Added `business_id` (references businesses)
   - Added index on `media_type` for faster queries

2. **Slide Media Table**:
   - Added `order` field for ordering media within a slide
   - Added `duration` field for specifying how long to display the media
   - Added `audio_media_id` field for associating audio with image media
   - Added `qr_id` field for associating a QR code with the media
   - Added `description` field for adding a description to the media
   - Added `text_size` field for configuring the size of the description text
   - Added `description_position` field for configuring the position of the description
   - Added index on `[slide_id, order]` for faster sorting

### Model Updates

1. **Media Model**:
   - Added relationships with owner and business
   - Added relationship with audio_slide_medias for when a media is used as audio
   - Added scopes for filtering by media type (images, videos, audios)
   - Added custom validation messages

2. **SlideMedia Model**:
   - Added relationships with audio_media and qr
   - Added validations for new fields
   - Added custom validation to ensure audio is only associated with image media
   - Added custom validation messages

### Controller Updates

1. **MediaController**:
   - Updated to use direct owner_id and business_id fields
   - Implemented file upload functionality
   - Added filtering by media_type
   - Updated ownership verification to check direct ownership first
   - Added file deletion when media is deleted

2. **SlideMediaController**:
   - Created new controller for managing slide-media relationships
   - Implemented CRUD operations
   - Added reorder functionality
   - Implemented comprehensive ownership verification

### Serializer Updates

1. **MediaSerializer**:
   - Updated to include owner and business information

2. **SlideMediaSerializer**:
   - Created new serializer to include all slide media fields and relationships

### Route Updates

1. **Media Routes**:
   - Added standard routes for media (index, show, create, update, destroy)
   - Added bulk delete route

2. **Slide Media Routes**:
   - Added standard routes for slide_media (show, create, update, destroy)
   - Added nested routes for slides and media
   - Added special route for reordering media within a slide

### Testing

A comprehensive test script `test_media_management.sh` was created to verify the implementation. The script tests:

1. Media upload for different types (image, audio, video)
2. Adding media to slides with various attributes
3. Retrieving media for a slide
4. Reordering media within a slide
5. Updating slide media attributes
6. Owner-based access control
7. Admin access to all media
8. Deleting slide media

### Documentation

1. **MEDIA_MANAGEMENT_FEATURES.md**:
   - Detailed documentation of the new features
   - API endpoints and parameters
   - Usage examples
   - Implementation notes

2. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**:
   - Updated with new media management endpoints
   - Request and response formats
   - Headers and parameters
   - Example JSON responses

## Conclusion

The implementation satisfies all the requirements specified in the issue description. Users can now upload and manage different types of media, associate them with slides, and configure how they are displayed. The implementation includes owner-based access control, ensuring that users can only manage their own media.

The code is well-structured, follows best practices, and includes comprehensive documentation and testing. The implementation is ready for use in the production environment.
